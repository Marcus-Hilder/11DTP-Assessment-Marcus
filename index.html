                    <p>Football, is a captivating game played by two teams, each consisting 
                      of eleven players. The objective is to maneuver a ball into the opposing 
                      team’s goal using any part of the body except the hands and arms. The only 
                      exception is the goalkeeper, who is allowed to handle the ball but only 
                      within the penalty area surrounding the goal.
